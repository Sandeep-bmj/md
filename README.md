This repository, wp-internationalforum.bmj.com, exclusively holds live production data for our internationalforum.bmj.com website. It's important to note that this is a special scenario where we maintain separate data for both staging and live environments.

## How should I begin working in this repository?
If you're starting any work in this repository, it's best to first clone it locally, then switch to the developer branch to make your changes. After modifying any files, add them, commit the changes, and push them to the repository. Once you push the code into the repository, GHA will run automatically, and you can see the changes reflected on the site. This is the current workflow that we are using.
