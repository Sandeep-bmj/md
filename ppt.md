## Slide 4: Milestones Achieved
**Phase One Completed:**
- GHA enabled for all WordPress sites.
- Unified, automated, and reliable CI/CD pipeline.

**Next Phase:**
- Automate GitHub tags, releases, and release notes.
- Improved versioning and documentation.
- Enhanced transparency in release processes.

## Slide 5: GitHub Actions Workflow
**Title:** First Phase: GHA CI/CD Pipeline

**Before GHA:**
- Fragmented deployment processes.
  - Jenkins for some sites.
  - FTP-based deployments for others.
- Challenges: delays, errors, inefficiencies.

**With GHA:**
- Unified CI/CD pipeline.
- Standardized and automated deployments.

## Slide 6: GHA Workflow Stages
**Steps:**
1. Create a branch for the ticket and implement changes.
2. Submit a Pull Request (PR) to the master branch and assign reviewers.
3. **Staging Pipeline:** Automatically updates the staging site.
4. Changes validated by Developers and QA Team.
5. **Production Pipeline:** Merges PR into the master branch, triggering the final deployment.
